# Low Power DSP MAC Unit using Approximate Circuits

## 📌 Description
This project implements a low power MAC unit using approximate adders, targeting real-time DSP applications. It aims to reduce power consumption with tolerable accuracy loss.

## 🚀 Features
- Approximate ripple carry adder (8-bit)
- MAC operation with Verilog
- Testbench with input stimulus
- Waveform analysis 
- Power and area comparison report

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Cadence(Xcelium, Genus)
- Verilog HDL
- System Verilog

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `src/` – Verilog code
- `tb/` – SystemVerilog testbenches
- `reports/` – Power, area, waveform results
